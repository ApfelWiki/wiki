		<h3 id="htmlStructure"><strong>A) Setting up stylized</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>stylized is an HTML theme for your business / portoflio. It's a perfect way for you to show your services and give the users some examples of your work in a very stylish way. This theme uses a fixed layout. All of the information within the main content area is nested within a div with an id or class.</p>

<p>To install the theme, put the stylized-Theme folder in the root directory of your website (you don't have to upload the 'Help' and 'PSD' map)</p>

		<p><strong>Setting it Up.</strong><br />
		<small>Note: you can use any text-editor you like to edit the files.</small></p>
		
		<h3>Step 1 - The <strong>Home</strong> page</h3>

		<p>The home page uses a slider and has 3 columns to explain your services. To change the slider images you can do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Create you own images and make sure is has a width of 819px and a height of 312px</li>
			<li>Go to the 'images' map and upload your images into that map.</li>
			<li>Open up the index.html with a text-editor and edit the paths to the images on line 83.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<img src="assets/images/homecode.jpg" alt="" />
		
		<p>You can change the text in the columns the same way:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Open up the index.html again and search for the 'INFO BOX' div (line 97).</li>
			<li>Copy in your own text and save the file</li>
		</ul>
		
		<img src="assets/images/homecode-2.jpg" alt="" />
		
		<br /><br />
		
		<h3>Step 2 - The <strong>Portfolio</strong> page</h3>

		<p>The portfolio page is where you can showcase your work. There's a slider at the top of the page with thumnails. When a visitor clicks the thumbnail, a project will be shown underneath it. To add your own thumbnails, showcase preview images and project info you can do the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Create you own thumbnails and make sure they have a width of 209px and a height of 108px</li>
			<li>Create you own showcase images and make sure they have a width of 502px (the height isn't important.</li>
			<li>Go to the 'images/projects' map and upload your images into that map.</li>
			<li>Open up the portfolio.html with a text-editor and edit the paths to the images (see following screenshot).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<img src="assets/images/portfoliocode.jpg" alt="" />
		
		<ul>
			<li>To change the text, open up the portfolio.html again and replace the text in the particular 'item' division.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<img src="assets/images/portfoliocode-2.jpg" alt="" />
		
		<p>Currently there are 9 examples of portfolio items. You can change this yourself by deleting or adding the lines of codes that belong to the portfolio item.</p><br />

		<h3>Step 3 - The <strong>Services</strong> page</h3>
		
		<p>The services page is where you want to explain to your visitors what it is that you do. To edit this page do the following:</p>
		   <ul>
			<li>Open up services.html with your text-editor.</li>
			<li>Replace the text in the 'Services box' that is already there with your own text.</li>
		   </ul>
		   
		   <img src="assets/images/servicescode.jpg" alt="" />
		   
		   <ul>
		    <li>Make sure that you change the h2-element with your page title, the h3-element with your service title and the p-element with the information on the service.</li>
		   </ul>
		  
		<p>To change the testimonials on the right side of the page you do the following:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Open up services.html with your text-editor.</li>
			<li>Replace the text that is already there with your own text.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<img src="assets/images/servicescode-2.jpg" alt="" />

		<br /><br />

		<h3>Step 4 - The <strong>Contact</strong> page</h3>
		
		<p>The contact page is has a contact form on the left side and an image with address info underneath it on the right side. The form itself is just based on elements and does not work without any PHP code. You'll need to contact a scripter to build you a script for this form or, if you know what you're doing, do it yourself with one of the many contact form scripts out there.</p>
		
		<img src="assets/images/contactcode.jpg" alt="" />
		
		<p>To change the image on the right side:</p>
		   <ul>
			<li>Create your own 380px by 350px image and upload it to you 'images' map.</li>
			<li>Open up the contact.html page with you text-editor and replace the following code:</li>
		   </ul>
		   
		  <img src="assets/images/contactcode-2.jpg" alt="" />
		  
		  <br /><br />
		  
		<hr>

		<h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>B) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>I'm using four CSS files in this theme. Two of these files are for the sIFR type in the pages, you don't need to worry about these. The other two are responsible for the global look of the template.</p> 
		
		<ol>
				<li>global.css</li>
				<li>ie6.css</li>
				<li>sifr.css</li>
				<li>sifr-font.css</li>
			</ol>

		<p>The main global.css file contains all of the specific stylings for the pages. The file is separated into sections using:</p>  

<pre>	
/* ### GENERAL ### */

	some code

/* ### HEADER CONTAINER ### */
	
	some code
	
/* ### MENU CONTAINER ### */

	some code
	
/* ### CONTENT CONTAINER ### */

	some code
	
/* ### FOOTER CONTAINER ### */

	some code
	
	etc, etc. 
</pre>
		
		<p>If you would like to edit a specific section of the site, simply find the appropriate label in the CSS file, and then scroll down until you find the appropriate style that needs to be edited.</p> 

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="javascript"><strong>C) JavaScript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>This theme imports 6 Javascript files.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>sIFR</li>
			<li>Sliders</li>
		</ol>
		  
		<p>jQuery is a Javascript library that greatly reduces the amount of code that you must write. The animation in this site is carried out from the slider scripts. There's no need to change anything in here except for the animation time of the featured slider.</p>
			
		<ul>
			<li>To change the time loop of the slider on the homepage, just open up 'javascripts/slider.js' and change the 800 on line 51 to any number you like (1000 = 1 second).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<img src="assets/images/javascriptcode.jpg" alt="" />
		
		<ul>
			<li>To change the time loop of the slider on the portfolio page, just open up 'javascripts/sslider.js' and change the 100 on line 53 to any number you like (1000 = 1 second).
		</ul>

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="psdFiles"><strong>D) PSD Files</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>I've included one psd file with this theme.</p>
		
			<ol>
				<li>stylized.psd</li>
			</ol>
		
		<p>Each page in this psd has it's own map and all the layers are arranged properly.</p> 
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="credits"><strong>E) Sources and Credits</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>I've used the following images, icons or other files as listed.</p>
		
<ul>

	<li><a title="jQuery Slider" href="http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider">jQuery Slider</a></li>
	<li><a title="Flavour Extended" href="http://www.addictedtocoffee.de/">Flavour Extended icon set</a> from Oliver Twardowski</li>
	<li><a title="Aller" href="http://www.dmjx.dk/international/press/font.html">Aller</a> font from Henrik Birkvig</li>
	<li><a title="sIFR" href="http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr/">sIFR</a> Text Replacement</li>
</ul>

		<p>Once again, thank you so much for purchasing this theme. As I said at the beginning, I'd be glad to help you if you have any questions relating to this theme. No guarantees, but I'll do my best to assist. If you have a more general question relating to the themes on ThemeForest, you might consider visiting the forums and asking your question in the "Item Discussion" section.</p>
